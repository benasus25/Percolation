This is a simple project based on the implementation of union find algorithn to calculate percolation threshold. 
The inspiration for this project was taken from a Princeton assignment (https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/percolation/specification.php)

Q- What is percolation?<br>
Ans(from the Princeton assignment) -  Given a composite systems comprised of randomly distributed insulating and metallic materials: what fraction of the materials need to be metallic so that the composite system is an electrical conductor? Given a porous landscape with water on the surface (or oil below), under what conditions will the water be able to drain through to the bottom (or the oil to gush through to the surface)? Scientists have defined an abstract process known as percolation to model such situations.

The percolation threshold can not be calculated by a mathematical formula and hence there is a need of a simulation solution for the aforementioned problem.
The simulation used in this case is the Monte Carlo simulation.

Q- What is Monte Carlo Simulation?<br> 
Ans(from Investopedia) - Monte Carlo simulations are used to model the probability of different outcomes in a process that cannot easily be predicted due to the intervention of random variables. It is a technique used to understand the impact of risk and uncertainty in prediction and forecasting models.
